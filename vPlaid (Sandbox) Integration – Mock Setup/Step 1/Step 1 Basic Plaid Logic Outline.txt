Plaid can connect bank accounts (even in sandbox mode) and simulate deposits/withdrawals. You'd use this to show:

Verified savings

Transaction logs

Since Plaid has no official Flutter SDK, youâ€™ll use:

Backend (Node.js/Python) for Plaid token exchange

Frontend Flutter app makes HTTP requests to backend
